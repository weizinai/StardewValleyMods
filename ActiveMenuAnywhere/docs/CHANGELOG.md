# Changelog

# [Unreleased] 1.7.2

- Migrated logging to PiCore (removed the Common shared project); console logs still show each mod's own name
- Migrated Harmony patches to the PiCore `Patcher` API (single-line `Patch<T>` bindings); no gameplay change
- Migrated the config menu to the PiCore `ConfigService`/descriptor config module (static `ModConfig.Instance`, corrupt-config self-heal, enum menu-tab option now via the module's localized enum option); no gameplay change
